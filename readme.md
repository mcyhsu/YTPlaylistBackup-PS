# YouTube Playlist Backup Script - PowerShell

## What Problem Does This Script Solve?

If you've ever maintained a large music playlist on YouTube, you've probably encountered this horrific sight:

While this script cannot prevent videos from getting deleted, it can at least make the process of replacing the deleted videos a lot easier.

## What Does This Script Do?

The YouTube Playlist Backup script **saves the Title, Uploader, Description, and URL information of each video in a YouTube playlist into a CSV file** for archival purposes.

Here's a preview of what a CSV generated by this script looks like:

This is useful for maintaining a music playlist when videos get deleted or set to private and you don't know which ones. 

Preserve the playlist data just as it was before the videos got removed - you can check the CSV file and replace the inaccessible videos. Then run the script again to generate a fresh CSV of your cleaned up playlist.

## How to Use This Script
Download and open the script in your preferred environment (E.g. VS Code).

To get started, you need to know three things:
1. **Your YouTube API key**
2. **Your playlist IDs**
3. **The destination folder path**

If you already know them, simply replace the placeholder values at the top of the script and then run it to save the playlist data as CSVs to the destination folder.

Otherwise, I'll explain where you can find each of these things next.

## 1. YouTube API Key
Follow the instructions laid out [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) to get access to a YouTube API key.

The API key should look like a long string of random characters, something like this:
```
BIzaTyC-GRb9yGzWzhitjvWXj9Z-RqbdyDKbS6A
```
Replace the **$apiKey** placeholder value with your actual APIkey.
```
$apiKey = "BIzaTyC-GRb9yGzWzhitjvWXj9Z-RqbdyDKbS6A"
```

## 2. YouTube Playlist IDs
Next you need to find your playlist IDs. This is **NOT** the same as the URL.

 :x:**Incorrect:**
```
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtDp75hOzOlbD7m-Gb2t4dZqyYx7dq0iB
```
From the URL, omit the "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=" part.

:white_check_mark:**Correct:**
```
PLtDp75hOzOlbD7m-Gb2t4dZqyYx7dq0iB
```
Change the placeholder values in **$playlistIds**. Enter at least one playlist ID, separate with a comma if you have multiple IDs, like so:
```
$playlistIds = @("PLtDp75hOzOlbD7m-Gb2t4dZqyYx7dq0iB","PL5075BB69F757047E")
```

## 3. Destination Folder Path
Lastly, enter the destination folder path into the **$destination** variable, like so:
```
$destination = "c:/path/to/destination/"
```
This is where the script will save your CSV files. It will create one CSV per playlist.

So if you entered 3 playlist IDs, expect to see 3 CSVs saved into that folder when you run the script.

And that's it!
